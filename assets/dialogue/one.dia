# Dialogue Box 1
Dave7:Hey you! Yeah you - the hand! I know we've had our differences in the past but I need your help to put our body
back together again. Our chest abandoned us, after it left so did the other parts of our body because apparently I
can't "keep us together". Anyway let's not get into who... said what to who... I need you to go after our chest first,
its through the maze past the top right door. Bring it back here and then we can go get the rest of us! One last thing,
there's dimensionally unstable barrels lying around, you can move them, probably...
Good luck!
